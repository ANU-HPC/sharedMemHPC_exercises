
# Shared Memory Programming for High Performance Computing: Exercises

## Getting Started

We will use NCI's Intel-based [Gadi](./systems.md) system for all the exercises in this course. An ARM-based system will also be used for some exercises.

[Log in to Gadi](./systems.md#logging-in) via SSH.

You should clone this Git repository to your home directory on Gadi for use in all hands-on sessions. Run the following command after logging into Gadi:

`git clone git@github.com:ANU-HPC/sharedMemHPC_exercises.git`

## Acknowledgements

This course is based on material developed by current and former ANU staff, including Peter Strazdins, Alistair Rendell, and Josh Milthorpe.
